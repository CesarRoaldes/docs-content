Scaleway Savings Plans are flexible pricing models that provide discounts over pay-as-you-go pricing in exchange for a commitment to use a consistent amount of resources over a specific period.

## How do Savings Plans work?



When you purchase a savings plan, you must commit to a monthly resource consumption amount before taxes and discounts. You are charged for resource consumption within your commitment based on the savings plan unit price. For resource consumption beyond your commitment, you are charged at the regular pay-as-you-go (or On-demand) unit price. You are charged the full committed consumption amount after savings discount (or just savings) per month even if your resource consumption amount does not reach the monthly committed amount. The customer commits to a consumption amount at the public price, not a consumption amount after applying the savings plan discount.

A savings plan is a commitment and discount plan that Scaleway provides. When you purchase a savings plan, you make a commitment to use a consistent amount of resources on a monthly basis for a specific period of time, such as one, two, or three years, to receive discounted billing. A savings plan is more cost-effective than the pay-as-you-go billing method. Compared with the reservation billing model, the combination of savings plans and the pay-as-you-go billing method is more flexible.
