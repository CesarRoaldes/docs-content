When you are invited to join an Organization that enforces MFA, you receive an invitation via email. If you do not yet have a Scaleway account upon receiving this email, you will not be able to effectively join the Organization.

You can follow the steps below to activate your Scaleway account and join the Organization you were invited to.

1. Click **Accept Invitation** in the email you received inviting you to join an existing Scaleway Organization.
    <Message type="important">
      When you click the link, you are redirected to the Scaleway console. Since you do not have a Scaleway account at this point, you will not be able to log into the console.
    </Message>
2. Go back to your personal email mailbox.
3. Check if you have received an email from Scaleway with the following subject: **[Action Required] Confirm Your Scaleway Account**.
4. Open the email if you have received it.
    <Message type="important">
      If you have not received the email, check that it has not been sent to SPAM. If it is not in your SPAM folder, wait a while longer to see if you will receive the email. You can also contact the person who invited you to re-send the invitation. If none of these options work, open a ticket and [contact our support team](https://console.scaleway.com/support/tickets).
    </Message>
5. Read through the Scaleway Terms of Service and Data Protection Agreement. You can find them in the PDFs attached to the email.
6. Click **I Accept Scaleway's Terms Of Service And I Accept Scaleway's Data Protection Agreement**. You are redirected to a page in the Scaleway console, confirming you have successfully accepted the Terms of Service and Data Protection Agreement.
7. Click **Go to Scaleway console**. You are redirected to the login screen.
8. Click **Send a magic link** to log in without a password.
    <Message type="tip">
      Optionally, go to **My profile** > **Create password** to create a new password.
    </Message>
9. Follow the [How to sign in with a magic link](/console/my-account/how-to/sign-in-with-magic-link/) procedure to log into the Scaleway console.
10. Follow the [How to use MFA](/console/my-account/how-to/use-2fa/) procedure to enable MFA in your account.
11. Go back to the Organization invitation email in your mailbox.
12. Click **Accept Invitation** again. You are redirected to the Scaleway console.
13. Check that you can see the name of the Organization you joined on the top right menu.
