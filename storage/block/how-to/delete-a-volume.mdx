  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have [created](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) a Block Storage volume
</Message>

<Message type="important">
  - You must detach your volume from the Instance it is linked to. Refer to our documenation to find out [how to do so](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume/).
  - We highly recommend that you [unmount](/storage/block/api-cli/unmounting-a-volume/) your device from the operating system before detaching the Block Storage volume, to avoid data loss.
