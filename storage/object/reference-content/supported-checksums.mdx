Scaleway Object Storage supports several checksum algorithms that allow you to verify the integrity of your objects:

- **CRC32**: a non-cryptographic checksum that generates a 32-bit hash value used to detect errors in data transmission, by applying a specific cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm.

- **CRC32C**: a checksum algorithm that uses the Castagnoli polynomial for improved error-detection performance over the standard CRC32.

- **SHA-1**: a cryptographic Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) that generates a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value from input data.

- **SHA-256**: a cryptographic Secure Hash Algorithm that generates a 256-bit unique hash value, preferred for modern security protocols due to SHA-1 vulnerabilities.
