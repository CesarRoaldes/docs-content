This documentation provides information about how Transactional Email handles [email headers](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#email-header).

## Email headers best practices

### Mandatory headers

Email headers provide valuable information about errors or security issues during the sending of your emails, that you can use to improve [deliverability](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#deliverability).
When using Transactional Email, the following headers are mandatory to avoid a bad [reputation score](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#reputation-score):

- **Date**: The date and time at which the email is sent.
- **From**: The name and email address of the sender.
- **To** or **Cc** or **Bcc**: The name and/or email address of the receiver.
- **Sender**: The name and email address of the sender, if there are several email addresses in the **From** header.

### Other headers

As defined in the RFC 3522 (section 3.6), the following headers should appear no more than once in the email. Using them more than once affects the domain's reputation score.

- **Orig-Date**:
- **From**:
- **Sender**:
- **Reply-To**:
- **To**:
- **Cc**:
- **Bcc**:
- **Message-ID**:
- **In-Reply-To**:
- **References**:
