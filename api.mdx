The Scaleway API allows you to create and manage all your Scaleway resources programatically.

Anything you can do through the Scaleway console can also be done through the API, from creating Instances to attaching them to Private Networks, to configuring Identity and Access Management, and more.

Curl examples are provided throughout our API documentation. However, calls to the Scaleway API can can also be made via various other libraries, SDKs and devtools.

## Quickstart: First request

1. [Generate your API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/).

2. Run the curl request below in your browser. Make sure you replace `<your-secret-key>` with the secret part of your API key.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
        -H "X-Auth-Token: <your-secret-key>" \
        -H "ContentType: application/json" \
        "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/servers"
    ```

    The response will be a JSON list of your Instances in the `fr-par-1` region, and their details.

    See [How to authenticate](#authentication) for information on generating API keys, and [Endpoints](#endpoints) for further details on how the HTTPS endpoint breaks down.

## How to authenticate

Each request made to Scaleway API must be authenticated by sending an `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header with each request. This header contains the secret key part of your Scaleway API key, which you can [generate on the Scaleway console](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/).

We recommend exporting your secret key as an environment variable, which you can then pass directly in your curl request as follows. Remember to replace the example value with your own API secret key.

    ```bash
    export SCW_SECRET_KEY=720438f9-fcb9-4ebb-80a7-808ebf15314b
    ```

    Curl request:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
        -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
        -H "ContentType: application/json" \
        "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/servers"
    ```

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

An API key always inherits the IAM permissions of its **bearer**: the [IAM user](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#user) or [IAM application](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#account) with which the key is associated. 

If the API key is associated with the Owner of a Scaleway Organization, it has full rights and permissions for actions within that Organization. Otherwise, it has the permissions defined for the bearer in the Organization via [policies](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/policy/).


## Requests and responses

### Requests 

An API **request** consists of a call to the Scaleway API, asking it to carry out an action or provide information.

Each API request will include a specified **method**, depending on the action you wish to perform:

| Request method    |   Usage                           | Example   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| `GET`             | Used to get a resource from a server. The server looks for the data you have requested, and sends it back to you. | List your Instances: `GET /instance/v1/zones/{zone}/servers` |
| `POST`            | Often used to create a resource, this method provides additional data such as a JSON payload sent from the client to the server in the message body. | Create an Instance: `POST instance/v1/zones/{zone}/servers` |
| `PATCH`           | Used to modify an existing resource | Update an Instance: `PATCH
/instance/v1/zones/{zone}/servers/{server_id}` |
| `DELETE`          | Used to delete a resource | Delete an Instance: `DELETE /instance/v1/zones/{zone}/servers/{server_id}` |

Example request to list existing flexible IPs:

```bash
curl -X GET \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: $SCW_SECRET_KEY" \
    -H "ContentType: application/json" \
    "https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/ips"
```

### Responses

After receiving a request, the API sends a **response**. This consists of the response body, headers and the HTTP status code. When a request is successful, the response body will typically be sent back in the form of a JSON object. An exception to this is when a `DELETE` request is processed, which will result in an empty response body.

Example response to the curl above, listing existing flexible IPs:

```bash
{
   "ips":[
      {
         "id":"b483671d-677f-435f-9de9-9a1adee70f25",
         "address":"50.17.253.160",
         "reverse":null,
         "server":{
            "id":"f9c1998a-9af8-4e2f-b6b7-9b9030daaa71",
            "name":"my-instance"
         },
         "organization":"8e3b57b8-eee9-4de1-975e-522c48c0dac0",
         "project":"a6cdba1f-2ee2-4a04-a5af-2d457b194ee3",
         "zone":"fr-par-1",
         "tags":[
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```
