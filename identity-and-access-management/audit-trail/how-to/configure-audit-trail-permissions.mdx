This page teaches you how to configure the necessary permission set to access [Audit Trail](/identity-and-access-management/audit-trail/concepts/#audit-trail).

## How to configure the Audit Trail permission set

To start using Audit Trail you need to configure the `AuditTrailReadOnly` permission set in [IAM](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#iam). The [scope](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#scope) of this permission set is at [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#organization) level.

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.
2. [Create an IAM policy](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-policy/) and perform steps one to five.
3. Select the **Access to Organization features** scope and click **Validate** to move on to the next step.
    <Message type="important">
     The **Access to Organization features** scope allows you to give the [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) permissions to Organization-level features such as IAM, Audit Trail, billing, support and abuse tickets, and project management.

4. Click the **Security and Identity** category in the **Products** section, then choose the **AuditTrailReadOnly** permission set.
5. Click **Validate**.
6. Click **Create policy**.

You now have access to Audit Trail.
