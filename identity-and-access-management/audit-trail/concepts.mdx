## Action

An action in the context of Audit Trail is the method performed on any of your Scaleway resources throught the API.

## Audit Trail

Audit Trail is a tool that holds a record of events and changes performed within a Scaleway Organization. Audit Trail allows you to keep track of all actions, whether successful, attempted, or failed, perfomed on your Scaleway resources.

With Audit Trail you can view [actions](/identity-and-access-management/audit-trail/concepts/#action) taken by any [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#principal) in any Project and on any of your Scaleway resources. You can also see the API methods used, the outcome of the action performed (status), and the IP adress from which a principal performed an action.

Audit Trail allows you to view the metadata of the API method used, allowing you to investigate incidents and troubleshoot issues.

## Event

An event is a log of user activity on your Scaleway resources.

## Region

A region is the geographical area in which your resources are located. They are duplicated on all [Availability Zones](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) of the selected region (Paris, Amsterdam, or Warsaw).

Audit Trail allows you to select your resources by region. This allows you to better sort through your resources.Ã ction`
