## Audit Trail

Audit Trail is a tool that allows you to keep track of the activity of your Scaleway resources.

With Audit Trail you can view user activity, access events, and system changes performed on your Scaleway resources integrated with Audit Trail.

## Region

A region is the geographical area in which your resources are located. They are duplicated on all [Availability Zones](/compute/instances/concepts/#availability-zone) of the selected region (Paris, Amsterdam, or Warsaw).

Audit Trail allows you to select your resources by region. This allows you to better sort through your resources.
