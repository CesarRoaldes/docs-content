FerretDB is an open-source database engine that provides a MongoDB®-compatible API layer over a PostgreSQL engine to store and retrieve data.



Many developers like being able to query document data through a JSON-structured query language. PostgreSQL is a rock-solid database system we really like and already provide as a managed version. But we also know that using SQL structure, avoiding SQL injection, or switching to its document query symbols (→, @>, or ?) can be a turn-off for some, especially when entire codebases depend on it, and migrating a database is far from being a business priority or a de-stressing weekend activity.

FerretDB combines the best of both worlds by building on reliable and proven open-source software and enhancing it with the MongoDB®-like APIs and features developers love.

FerretDB is still an emerging open-source technology, and after multiple chats with the FerretDB team, we found out that the most useful contribution we could provide as a cloud provider would be to integrate FerretDB into our Managed Database stack — which would also have the benefit of easing the deployment and management of databases as much as possible for developers.

Our integration of FerretDB will give you fast and smooth access to FerretDB’s technology and let you test it and provide FerretDB with feedback on concrete use cases, as well as on any compatibility and performance issues.

Thanks to its architecture, integrating FerretDB is as simple as running a FerretDB container side by side with another PostgreSQL container. That made it really easy to add FerretDB to our existing Managed Relational Database stack.


FerretDB can run safely on our virtual machines and benefit from existing failover capabilities so that incoming requests can be redirected to the right instances in case of a failure. It also integrates well with our existing monitoring stack, and we can send FerretDB metrics and logs to our observability product, which is based on Grafana.

Finally, FerretDB’s support of mongodump and mongorestore commands makes upgrading FerretDB as easy as dumping data, restarting FerretDB containers, and restoring dumped data. This is particularly valuable in such an early-stage project, as we want to upgrade to the latest stable FerretDB version every few days to get access to new features and see progress quickly.
