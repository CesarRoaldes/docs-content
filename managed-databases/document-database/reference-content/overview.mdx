FerretDB is an open-source database engine that provides a MongoDB®-compatible API layer over a PostgreSQL engine to store and retrieve data.

The engine allows the query of document data through a NoSQL, JSON-structured query language.

FerretDB relies on a modular architecture built on top of PostgreSQL. Documents are stored in binary JSON format using the corresponding PostgreSQL column type. FerretDB also uses several tables in PostgreSQL to store database structure information such as database names, collection names, and user access management.

FerretDB translates MongoDB® wire protocol queries to SQL to be remain compatible with existing software and tools built on MongoDB®.
